Glucocorticoids (GCs) and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are routinely prescribed treatments that have shown good therapeutic effects on disease control [2] . Currently, non-biological DMARDs like azathioprine, methotrexate (MTX), and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) play a role in relieving pain and inhibiting disease progression [3] . Among these drugs, HCQ was initially used as an antimalarial medication and then translated to rheumatic diseases. Currently, HCQ is the mainstay treatment for SLE; according to the latest European guidelines, it is recommended for all SLE patients unless contraindicated or with adverse effects [4] . The latest European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations stated that HCQ was also part of the triple therapy in RA, where it is combined with methotrexate and sulfasalazine to increase the response rate [5] . Despite the efficacy of HCQ in treating manifestations of SLE and RA, common side effects such as headaches, dizziness, gastrointestinal symptoms, and rash have been reported [6] . Notably, retinopathy is a serious side effect of HCQ, and regular ophthalmologic monitoring is recommended for patients on long-term HCQ therapy [7, 8] .",

            "text": "HCQ shows large interindividual variations in its blood concentration, despite individuals taking the same dose. For SLE patients on long-term oral HCQ treatment, a lower SLE disease activity index (SLE-DAI) score was significantly associated with higher blood HCQ concentration [9] . Moreover, metabolites of HCQ such as desethyl hydroxychloroquine (DHCQ) and desethyl chloroquine (DCQ) exhibited a concentration-dependent relationship in patients with RA; bisdesethyl chloroquine (BDCQ) has also been implicated in HCQ toxicity [10] . HCQ is metabolized into DHCQ, DCQ, and BDCQ by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP450s) 3A4/5, 2C8, and 2D6 in vivo by N-deethylation [11] , in which DHCQ is the major metabolite and the activated form of HCQ. The CYP 2D6*10 (rs1065852) polymorphism is significantly associated with the level of DHCQ, while CYP3A5*3 (rs776746) and CYP 3A4*18 (rs28371759) did not show any significant association with the levels of HCQ and DHCQ [12] . However, to our knowledge, few studies thus far have reported the relationship between the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of HCQ and CYP450 polymorphisms [13] . Understanding this relationship will be helpful to refine HCQ dosage. Therefore, we analysed the influence of CYP450 gene polymorphisms, mainly the 2D6, 3A4, 3A5, and 2C8 polymorphisms, on the blood concentrations of HCQ and its metabolites, as well as the risk of ADRs.",

The exclusion criteria were as follows: non-SLE and non-RA patients; pregnant and lactating women; patients with incomplete data; patients with poor compliance; and those with renal impairments, eye disease, or cutaneous damage before receiving HCQ. Blood samples (10 mL) were collected during an outpatient visit for determining HCQ, DHCQ, DCQ, and BDCQ blood concentrations and genetic testing. The following laboratory tests were conducted: complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, levels of C3 and C4, and anti-double-stranded DNA antibody titre.",

The plasma concentrations of HCQ, DHCQ, DCQ, and BDCQ were 838.10 \u00b1 522.00, 582.80 \u00b1 363.90, 346.90 \u00b1 205.30, and 56.00 \u00b1 39.30 ng/ml, respectively. Grouped according to the dosage of patients, the results showed that blood concentrations of HCQ, DHCQ, DCQ, and BDCQ were significantly associated with the daily HCQ dosage (P < 0.005) (Fig. 1 ). The relationships between blood concentrations of HCQ, DHCQ, DCQ, and BDCQ and the duration of oral HCQ are shown in Fig. 2a -d, respectively. The blood concentrations of HCQ, DHCQ, DCQ, and BDCQ also showed a significant correlation (P < 0.005). The distribution of ADRs among all patients was as follows: abnormal renal function (n = 21), abnormal liver function (n = 11), ophthalmic ADRs (n = 20), and skin and mucous membrane ADRs (n = 15).",

            "text": "HCQ is a hydroxyl derivative of chloroquine (CQ) and has a similar antimalarial activity to CQ. However, because HCQ has low toxicity, it can be used in the longterm treatment of SLE and RA. The plasma elimination half-life of HCQ is about 40-60 days, with higher tissue distribution and longer residence time in vivo [18] . Despite the potential efficacy and relative safety, the indications for and dosage of HCQ should be strictly controlled in clinical treatment. Furthermore, the ADRs should be closely observed, and HCQ blood levels of patients should be measured at regular intervals if necessary [19] . Studies have shown that there is a positive correlation between the efficacy of HCQ and its blood concentration. HCQ shows large inter-individual variations in its concentration, even in individuals taking the same dose [10] . About 40% of patients are unresponsive or intolerant to HCQ [20] . HCQ is mainly deacetylated by CYP450 enzymes 2D6, 2C8, and CYP3A4/5 [11, 12] ; therefore, genetic polymorphisms of HCQ metabolic enzymes may be an important factor that affects individual concentration differences. Lee et al. [12] studied the effect of CYP2D6 gene polymorphisms on the blood concentration of HCQ in patients with SLE. They found a significant correlation between rs1065852 and rs1135840 and the ratio of DHCQ:HCQ, which indicates that the blood concentration of HCQ is related to the CYP2D6 gene polymorphism, but no similar results were found in CYP3A5*3 (rs776746) and CYP3A4*18B (rs28371759). Although some studies have reported that there was no significant correlation between CYP2C8 gene polymorphism and patients' response to HCQ [10] , our previous research showed that SLE patients with the CYP2C8 (rs10882521) GT genotype who took the same dose of HCQ had lower blood concentration than those with other genotypes, indicating that this SNP is related to the blood concentration of HCQ [21] . CYP3A4 is the most abundant CYP450 enzyme in the human liver, accounting for about 80% of the total CYP450 enzymes. The newly discovered CYP3A4*1G (rs2242480) is the site with the highest mutation frequency in the CYP3A4 allele, and the CYP3A4*1G gene polymorphism can reduce the catalytic activity of the CYP3A4 enzyme [22] . In our present study, a correlation between CYP3A4 (rs28371759) and (rs2242480) gene polymorphism and blood concentration of HCQ was not found, which was consistent with the results reported in the literature [12] . We found that CYP3A4 (rs3735451) was significantly correlated with blood concentration of HCQ and its metabolites by adjusting for the time of administration, and the mean blood concentrations of HCQ, DHCQ, and DCQ in patients with CC, CT, and TT genotypes is higher than those of other genotypes, with the blood concentration of HCQ and its main metabolite DHCQ being the lowest for the CC genotype. It is suggested that for patients with CYP3A4 (rs3735451) site mutation, a higher dose may be needed in clinical treatment to achieve an effective blood concentration and therapeutic effect.",

In fact, Munster et al. [10] found a correlation between gastrointestinal adverse events and elevated blood HCQ levels, and a potential relationship between ophthalmic adverse events and BDCQ levels. The incidence of ophthalmic ADRs in the previous literature was 7.5% [24] ; the incidence in our present study was 14.4%, significantly higher than that previously reported. This may be due to the inclusion of more ophthalmic ADRs in our study, such as eye swelling, hyperaemia, blurred vision, and conscious ametropia. However, until now, there have been only a few reports on the association between ADRs of HCQ and CYP450 gene polymorphisms. In this study, we found a significant difference in the distribution of the CYP2C8 (rs10882526) GG genotype and AA + AG genotypes in the ophthalmic ADR group (P < 0.05), and the incidence of ADRs for the GG genotype was higher than that of the AA + AG genotypes. The most important predictors of ophthalmic ADRs in patients are high doses and long-term use of HCQ; hence, mandatory ophthalmic evaluation should be performed during long-term use of HCQ to ensure drug safety [25] .",

The reduced clearance in patients with renal insufficiency leads to HCQ accumulation in the body, significantly increasing the blood concentration after medication and the risk of drug poisoning. However, the dosage of HCQ in patients with renal insufficiency is not clear [26] . In this study, we analysed the relationship between CYP2C8 gene polymorphism and renal dysfunction. This showed a significant difference in the distribution of the AG genotype and AA + GG genotypes of CYP2C8 (rs1058932) between the normal and abnormal renal function groups. In addition, the distribution of the CYP3A5 (rs776746) TT genotype and CT + CC genotypes in patients with long-term HCQ use was significantly different from that in the normal group (P < 0.05).

Abnormal liver function, manifested by liver enzyme increase (aspartate aminotransferase, AST), was found in 11 patients in our study, but no influence of CYP450 gene polymorphism was found.

            "text": "The gene polymorphisms of the CYP enzyme may be important determinant of drug sensitivity and ADRs among different individuals. In the clinic, patients with the CYP2C8 (rs1058932) AG genotype had a higher incidence of renal dysfunction than those with the AA and GG genotypes after taking HCQ. Patients with the CYP2C8 (rs10882526) GG genotype had a higher incidence of ophthalmic ADRs than AA genotype and AG genotypes after taking HCQ. In addition, patients with the CYP3A5 (rs776746) TT genotype had a higher incidence of skin and mucosal ADRs than the CC and CT genotypes after taking HCQ. Given the same dose of HCQ, the blood concentration of HCQ in patients with the CYP3A4 (rs3735451) CC genotype was lower than that in patients with other genotypes. Thus, it may be helpful to improve the efficacy and reduce the ADRs by genotyping the relevant CYP450 gene polymorphisms before administration of HCQ and monitoring the concentration of HCQ and its metabolites. Physicians should try to offer individualised treatment with HCQ based on the results of CYP2C8 (rs1058932 and rs10882526), CYP3A4 (rs3735451), and CYP3A5 (rs776746) genotyping and HCQ blood concentration.
