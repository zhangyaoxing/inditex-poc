            "text": "Symmetrical peripheral gangrene (SPG) is a rare clinical syndrome first described by Hutchinson in 1891. 1 It is a subtype of purpura fulminans that can be defined as symmetrical distal ischemic damage in two or more extremities without evidence of vasculitis or occlusion of major vessels. [1] [2] [3] [4] The ischemic changes usually occur in fingers or toes but can also involve lips, ear lobules, nose, and external genitalia. 2, 3 Unfortunately, the exact pathophysiology of SPG is not well understood. However, some theories might correlate it to the Schwartzman reaction, bacterial endotoxin release, and platelet plugging causing a blood flow blockage at the microcirculation level. 1 This phenomenon is usually triggered by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 1 Among patients with SPG, limb amputation and mortality occur in up to 50% and 40% of patients, respectively. 5, 6 The causes of SPG can be classified into infectious and noninfectious. 1 The noninfectious causes may be due to cardiovascular diseases, connective tissue disorders, malignancy, the use of vasoactive drugs, or hematological diseases. 1, 7 Neisseria meningitidis is the most commonly recognized infection associated with SPG and purpura fulminans in children, whereas Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause in adults. 8 To date, there is still no definite treatment for SPG. The mainstay part of therapy focuses on treating the underlying cause or removing the aggravating factor. 9 Different types of vasodilating agents had been described in the management of digital ischemia or SPG without conclusive results. 5 Here, we present a child with SPG secondary to refractory culturesnegative septic shock treated by topical nitroglycerin 0.2%.",

However, over a few days, he became progressively lethargic and unwell for which he was brought to the emergency department. His symptoms included fever, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased activity, and decreased feeding for 4 days. The condition continued to worsen, and he developed signs of distributive shock 10 hours after the ward admission. Aggressive fluid resuscitation (reaching 60 mL/kg) and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated immediately. He was then transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with a picture of cold hypotensive shock with blood pressure been monitored continuously via the femoral arterial line. Epinephrine infusion started peripherally within the first hour of PICU admission, then switched centrally after central venous catheter insertion. Advanced hemodynamic monitoring using an Ultrasonic Cardiac Output Monitor (USCOM) confirmed a high systemic vascular resistance index. The patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated as his level of consciousness started to decrease due to an ongoing shock state and low brain perfusion condition. Epinephrine infusion was titrated up to a maximum of 0.25 mcg/kg/min, and norepinephrine infusion was also titrated to a maximum of 0.25 mcg/kg/min. Both failed to control the hypotension, as evident by arterial pressure monitoring and poor perfusion state. Most of the other differential diagnoses were excluded at that time, including macrophage activating syndrome and sepsis-induced cytokine storm (his ferritin level was 261 ng/ mL). Considering adrenal insufficiency as a sequelae of septic shock state, hydrocortisone (dose of 1 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours) was started with a minimal effect on blood pressure or perfusion. Then, vasopressin infusion was initiated with a rapid withdrawal of norepinephrine infusion. The hemodynamic status began to improve once we reached the vasopressin infusion rate of 0.7 mU/kg/min. All the superficial and deep bacterial cultures and viral testing including blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluids, nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, and Bronchoalveolar lavage cultures were negative. Serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG was positive with a negative IgM result. In view of patient presentation and clinical condition, septic shock could not be ruled out and the suspicion of culture-negative septic shock was considered.",

Six hours post-PICU admission, skin pallor was noticed over the distal aspect of the patient's fingers and toes on all extremities, as well as petechial rash over the palms and soles (Figure 1 ). These changes were noticed a while before starting vasopressin infusion. Radial and posterior tibial pulses in all limbs were detected using a Doppler device which raises the diagnosis of SPG adding more complexity to the case. Rapid weaning of vasoactive infusions in a stabilizing phase of shock carries a high risk of sudden deterioration with possible mortality. On the other hand, continuing with these high levels of infusions might worsen the SPG condition. As a response, vasoactive infusions were titrated to the lowest possible rate while maintaining hemodynamics. Unfortunately, specific investigations for thrombosis are not available in our center and were not done. Due to the urgency of the situation, heparin infusion was started aiming to control the potential development of the microthrombi. Vasoactive drugs were gradually tapered down until all were discontinued on day 4.",

Although all bacterial cultures failed to grow an organism, culture-negative septic shock remained the main working diagnosis due to the clinical presentation and the previous use of antibiotic prior to hospital admission.

            "text": "The exact pathogenesis of how SPG occurs is not well understood. The possible hypothesis includes a low blood flow state as a result of or in association with DIC. 13 Molos et al 14 noted DIC as an essential underlying factor in 85% of patients who develop SPG. Rarely, SPG can occur in the absence of DIC. 8 SPG might begin as petechial lesions due to capillary dilatation and red-cell extravasation with signs of fibrin deposition and microvascular necrosis. These petechial lesions merge over time to form hemorrhagic bullae in regions of ischemic necrosis. 8, 10 Critically ill patients with SPG have increased mortality compared to those without SPG, and a high risk of limb amputations in those fortunate enough to survive. 10 Some reports described the use of vasodilator agents to improve tissue perfusion in areas affected by SPG. These agents include intravenous (IV) prostaglandins, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, endothelin receptor antagonist, IV nitroprusside, IV trimethaphan, and topical nitroglycerin. 6, [15] [16] [17] [18] They were all reported with the various extent of effectiveness for digital ulceration or peripheral gangrene. Amputation, as a last resort, may be inevitable once the line of demarcation of the gangrene is developed. 19 Among available treatment options, topical nitroglycerin appears to be a relatively effective therapy in managing peripheral limb ischemia. Although there was limited evidence supporting any treatment for SPG, some neonatal case reports were advocating the use of topical nitroglycerin with a promising outcome without reporting any side effect. 20, 21 Nevertheless, it has been used in the prevention of skin flap necrosis and the management of diabetic ulcers. 22,23 Topical nitroglycerin selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) and prevents cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) from breaking down. Working on these pathways leads to smooth muscle relaxation in blood vessels. The vasodilating effect of topical nitroglycerin promotes microcirculation of blood flow in the digital limbs. Topical nitroglycerin is well absorbed through intact skin, delivering the highest dose to the area directly beneath. However, the amounts of nitroglycerin reaching the circulation vary in relation to the surface area size and the amount of ointment applied. 24 The onset of action is within 1 hour, and the hemodynamic effects last up to 6 hours. Frequent application over a large skin surface area can potentiate systemic effects of topical nitroglycerin and results in hypotension.",

In recent years, evidence has been published on nitroglycerin's efficacy to treat ischemic complications associated with vascular cannulation or drug extravasation. 20 The use of topical nitroglycerin in children is limited due to the lack of consensus on its safety and the proper dosage in pediatrics. The side effects of nitroglycerin may include hypotension and methemoglobinemia. In our case, we closely monitored the patient's blood pressure and methemoglobin level, while using topical nitroglycerin 0.2%. We did not observe any adverse effects.
